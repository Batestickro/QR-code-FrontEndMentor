## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Sass css

### What I learned

The project helps me understand better the concept to center the div in the screen, it looks easy however took me some time to figure it out, I had to use the viewport high property and couldn't find anothe way to add space to the body to center the qr-code, and then just with grid and one property the content is centered which I found interesting.

I also could check sass css even if it's a small design helped me have a better understanting of how to set up the tool.


```css
.body {
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [problems with viewport units](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veEqYQlfNx8) -This helped me when the body did not have space to center the content vertically and was just centering horizontally however the viewport units are problematic.
